1. NoSQL database is a database management system that can support structured, semi-structured and unstructured data, while
providing horizontal scalability performance and high availability. It provides faster data ingestion.

2. Data is stored in a single table instead of multiples tables, so there is no need to join tables.

3. Column Family provides shared features (like access pattern) to all it’s columns that are created within them. For that
reason it is meant for containing columns which have related data. Example Column family ‘Student_id’ can have 3 columns namely
‘first_name’, ‘middle_name’, ‘last_name’ and ‘roll_number’.

4. There is no limit to number of columns that can be added to HBase table.

5. The presence of column family definition allows columns within it to be defined on the fly without issues.

6. HMaster divides tables horizontally into regions. The region servers (nodes in the cluster) contain all the regions based on
assignment and capacity, and they serve data for reads and writes.

7. When new data is inserted into HBase table, write ahead log (WAL) stores that data which hasn’t been persisted to permanent
storage for recovery purposes. That same data is then stored into the MemStore of that column family in a sorted manner, before
it is written to disk. If the data is frequently read, Block Cache stores that data for quicker reads. Hfiles store the rows as
sorted Key-value pairs on disk.
